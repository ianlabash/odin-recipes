    <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p>You might not think of chili as an easy weeknight dish, but this turkey version from Pierre Franey will change your mind. 
            It's fabulous, it's healthy and it can be ready in about a half hour. A combination of dark and white meat really adds 
            depth and richness of flavor, so try to find a mix, but all white meat (or a mixture of ground beef and turkey) will 
            yield a stellar batch too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground turkeyu, white and dark combined</li>
            <li>2 cups coarsely chopped onions</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 large sweet red pepper, cored, deveined and coarsely chopped </li>
            <li>1 cup chopped celery </li>
            <li> 1 jalapeno pepper, cored, deveined and finely chopped </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped, or 1 tablespoon, dried </li>
            <li>2 bay leaves </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons chili powder </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin </li>
            <li>3 cups canned diced tomatoes </li>
            <li> 2 cups chicken broth, fresh or canned </li>
            <li> Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste </li>
            <li> 2 15-ounce cans of red kidney beans, drained </li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese </li>
            <li> 1 cup sour cream (optional) </li>
            <li>Sliced lime for garnish (optional) </li>


        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil over high heat in a large heavy pot and add the turkey meat. Cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes, chopping down and stirring with the side of a heavy kitchen spoon to break up any lumps.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, garlic, sweet pepper, celery, jalapeno pepper, oregano, bay leaves, chili powder and cumin. Stir to blend well. Cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the drained beans and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes longer. Serve in bowls with cheddar cheese, and sour cream and lime wedges, if desired</li>
